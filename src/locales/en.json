      "description": "This is an e-commerce functional prototype deployed on Vercel.\n\nI took a NextJs course to enhance my programming skills and knowledge about the technology. NextJs recently introduced significant changes with the new “App Router” version, and this project utilizes version 14 of Next. This allowed me to manage the backend through server actions.\n\nThe project also includes AuthJs for authentication verification and integrates a payment platform with PayPal. For testing purposes, the payment functionality is in sandbox mode. To simulate a payment, use this test account: [ojavio@gmail.com](mailto:ojavio@gmail.com) with the password: 12345678.\n\nFor improved security, all data is verified with the database. Even if a user tries to alter the data, it is retrieved from the backend. For payments, we obtain the status from PayPal APIs. We then save the order status and transaction ID in our database for extra transaction security.\n\nThe database is created and managed through a Prisma schema. This was my first time using this ORM for a PostgreSQL Database. It's a great technology due to the ease of creating tables and relations needed for an e-commerce platform. It also enhances type security to prevent errors when data is being created or modified. As mentioned earlier, the backend is made through server actions, which were easily implemented thanks to Prisma.\n\nThe website also includes Admin sections where users and products can be modified or deleted, making it more complete and scalable.\n\nOther technologies used include Zustand for easy global state management. During development, the database was hosted in a Docker container. The styles were implemented using Tailwind CSS.\n\nThis project was a significant learning experience. I gained a lot of knowledge about NextJs and its features, such as side rendering, server actions, and options to create dynamic metadata for optimal SEO. These features make this React Framework a good choice for projects like this.",

      "description": "One of my first web projects.\n\nNowadays, every professional searching for an opportunity needs to highlight their skills. That's why I created my portfolio to stand out to future enterprises or recruiters. It started as a class project. Initially, it was made using PHP to show data dynamically from a MySQL database. I could access an admin menu where I could edit or add more information in some areas.\n\nHowever, the service that allowed me to host the PHP project was somewhat expensive. So, I decided to convert everything into a static HTML file to host it on a Github page. I forgot to mention that the styling was made using Bootstrap and some CSS, of course. This worked for a long time, but having all the information in one file made it harder to read and edit. I also noticed many areas for optimization after working with other projects and people who taught me principles about separating content into different components and making my code readable and reusable.\n\nThat's why I decided in 2024 to revamp my Portfolio (the one you're viewing right now), fixing all the issues of the first version.\n\nI chose to showcase this simple project to demonstrate my evolution in logic, clean code, and component division. I also incorporated new technologies and libraries that allowed me to improve SEO, speed optimization, and features like internationalization, styling and responsive design\n\nAnyway, this first version could be easily used by anyone who is starting in this world and wants to practice some skills and have a first portfolio.",

      "description": "A Personal Project I started due to a necessity.\n\nProbably one of the social networks I use the most is Discord. That’s where I talk with my friends while we’re playing video games, and one of our favorite things is listening to music. We used to use one of the most famous music bots called Groovy. In our opinion, it was the best music bot due to its simplicity. Other bots required more user actions like choosing the song you wanted to play from several options shown, or sometimes didn’t give the expected results. With Groovy, you put the song or video you want to listen to, and the bot finds it exactly as you wanted. Also, the commands were very simple and did just what was needed. Other bots have several commands and sometimes were difficult to use.\n\nEverything was fine with Groovy, but during the pandemic, when social networks became more popular, something happened. It stopped functioning due to a cease and desist order issued by Google. Groovy was a popular bot that allowed users to play music from YouTube on their Discord servers. However, Google considered that the bot violated YouTube's terms of service, as it was used to stream music from YouTube without showing ads and, in some cases, allowed users to bypass usage restrictions.\n\nThe Groovy team received the cease and desist notice in August 2021 and announced that the bot would stop working by the end of that month. The decision to shut down Groovy was a direct response to this legal action to avoid further legal issues with Google.\n\nAfter Groovy's shutdown, other music bots on Discord faced similar situations, such as Rythm, which received a similar order shortly after. This indicates a broader effort by Google to enforce its terms of service and protect its copyrights and advertising revenue sources.\n\nThat was kind of sad for us because music is something essential for us. Several months passed, and we didn’t find a new replacement for Groovy, every bot was worse than the other. Most of them didn’t find the songs we wanted to play.\n\nThat’s when I saw one of my schoolmates making a very basic music Discord bot using Python packages of Discord. So I started to research how to make mine. I found thousands of videos, read the Discord documentation, and I decided to start the creation of my personal Discord Music Bot, keeping in mind the simplicity of Groovy. I wanted to create a bot closest to Groovy called Crummy (an antonym of Groovy).\n\nThat’s where I encountered technologies I didn’t know about such as FFmpeg and yt-dlp. These technologies allowed me to recreate the search functionality of Groovy. yt-dlp is a command-line program used for downloading videos and audio from various websites, including YouTube. It is a fork of the now-discontinued youtube-dl, and it includes several improvements and additional features. Probably it was the same tool Groovy used. But as a personal bot and not public, I wouldn’t have the same problems with Google. Then with FFmpeg, I got the link of the media to be reproduced. That resulted in a very functional bot keeping the simplicity and personal touches for our server.\n\nThe first version was uploaded to GitHub to help other people create a bot from zero. To make this achievable, a lot of work on documentation was done. If you look at the repo, you would see everything explained carefully to make it easier for each kind of audience.\n\nThe second version of the bot came with a lot of surprises, such as performance improvements, error handling, new commands and features, UI improvements using Discord resources, and Heroku option deployment with improvements in the documentation making a trustworthy image of the bot and making it more robust. With these last changes, the bot is near to what Groovy was and that was what I wanted from the beginning. Nowadays, we use that bot mainly. I hosted it myself due to Heroku's prices (it's not that expensive though), and we’re happy with it.",
